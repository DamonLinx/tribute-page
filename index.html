  <p class="p1">You can follow this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Black">(link) </a>, if you want a lot of technical information about Jack Black. I don't really care about that , I was inspired to do this tribute page by my daughter. You see, I have
    just started learning HTML and was told about <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>. I flew through the tutorials , but when it got to the point of making a tribute page I couldn't decide who to do it about. Thats when my daughter
    asked if she could use my computer to play Brutal Legend. That brought back memories of all the movies starring Jack Black that I have watched over the years. I must say , I'm a fan. Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny is truely a fun movie to watch.
    It had me laughing through the entire film. Now granted , it may not be for everyone , but I loved it.</p>
</div>
<p class="p2">I'm just going to talk about what I know about Jack Black. I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA4V-n8Ft3g">video </a>on youtube of a commercial he was in. It says it was his first commercial and I can remember it from when i was younger.
  It was for a game named pitfall on the atari 2600. Back in the day, it was ground breaking technology. He was pretty young at the time and it was a short clip but still worth checking out if your a fan. I believe this was the start of his career , and
  what a career it is. Tv , movies, music , comedy , and more. He truly is good at what he does.</p>

  <p class="p3"> The movie Year One is one of my favorites. Jack Black plays a hunter in a small tribe and eats from the tree of forbidden fruit. He gets himself kicked out of his tribe along with a gatherer name Oh played by Michael Cera. They get into all kinds of
    trouble and meet various characters from the bible, including Cain and Abel, Abraham and Issac. They eventually make ther way to the city of Sodem only to find there tribe has been enslaved there. There misadventures lead them to try and free the
    tribe and let me tell you there not real good at it. Jack Blacks character Zed tries to form an alliance with Princess Innana while Oh reconects with a former love intrest from his tribe. Things go every way but right for the two friends but it stays
    funny throughout it all. I believe this movie is a must see for any fan.</p>

  <p class="p4"> Now honestly I haven't played Brutal Legend yet, and let me stress yet. My daughter loves it and I suspect its mostly do to the music. I do know that Jack Black voices a character named Eddie Riggs who is a rodie and loves to Rock. He is transported
    into a heavy metal-themed fantasy world and the adventure begins. The games graphics look really nice and the gameplay looks very interesting, but I'd say the real selling point would be the Rock. Name another adventure game in which you can use rock
    and roll to combat your enemies and you've played more games than I have. It really looks like a fun game and having Jack Black voicing the main character only adds to the games overall appeal. I'm really looking forward to playing it but I have to
    wait until my daughter finishes it , do to the lack of seperate save files.</p>

  <p class="p4"> I could go on and on but I think I'll end my page here. I believe I have fullfilled all the necessary requirements for my tribute page for <a href="www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>. It doesn't look anything like there sample page but I went in
    a more relaxed direction. If you have read this, you have my thanks and I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
